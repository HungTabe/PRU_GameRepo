General Information
+ Game Name: Geometry Dashmin
+ Genre: Rhythm-based 2D Platformer
+ Platform: Laptop (PC)
+ Technology Used: Unity, C#
+ Target Audience: Fans of rhythm-based platformer games, arcade players, challenge-seekers
+ Graphics Style: Minimalist neon and geometric visuals
+ Gameplay Motivation: Overcome obstacle-filled levels by timing jumps perfectly, progressing through increasingly difficult stages.
Game Overview
+ Geometry Dashmin is a rhythm-based 2D platformer where players control a geometric character that automatically moves forward. The objective is to navigate through obstacle-filled levels by timing jumps perfectly. The game challenges players with increasingly difficult stages, requiring precision and quick reflexes.
+ Each level consists of two main gameplay phases:
Obstacle Navigation Phase: Players must jump over spikes, avoid hazards, and sync their movements with the rhythm of the background music.
Level Completion Phase: Successfully reaching the end of the level progresses the player to the next challenge. Unlike traditional games, there is no level selection screen—players advance linearly through the game.
Storyline
In a world of geometric shapes and endless challenges, a small cube embarks on a journey through dangerous obstacle courses. The only way forward is to jump at the right time, avoiding spikes and traps that stand in the way.
With each completed level, the path becomes harder, testing the player's skill and timing. There are no shortcuts—only those who master the rhythm and precision can reach the end.

 Controls
+ Spacebar: Jump / Control movement in different modes
Game Flow
+ Each level in Geometry Dashmin follows a structured progression with dynamic changes through portals.
Phase 1: Obstacle Navigation
The player’s character moves automatically from left to right.
The objective is to avoid obstacles (spikes, walls, gaps, etc.) by jumping or using different movement styles based on the active game mode.
Portals appear at certain points in the level, triggering game mode transformations that change how the character moves.
Phase 2: Level Completion
If the player successfully reaches the end of the level, they automatically progress to the next one.
Levels increase in difficulty, introducing more obstacles, tighter spaces, and faster speeds.
Unlike traditional games, there is no level selection screen—players must complete each stage sequentially.
